#INFO 247 Lab 01: HTML/CSS

##Instructions

###Setup
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open "index.html" & "main.css" in your text editor. 

###Goals
You are building a blog post page from an existing codebase that's half-finished. Take a look at result.jpg to see what the final result should be. Aim to mimic this as much as possible.

###Practice with HTML
1. Take a look at the overall DOM structure.
2. Create a menu using an unordered list HTML element.
3. The image gallery is enclosed in the "#gallery" div. However, all the image gallery items (image & caption text) are floating freely. Structure each of the item so it's in a container div--this allows you to apply styles to each item.

###Practice with CSS
1. Open the html file in a browser. The page contains the content of a typical blog page, but it doesn't look like much because there are no styles applied to it yet.
2. First, start by resetting the CSS (google this code).
3. Follow the specific instructions outlined in the CSS file.
4. Add more styles as you see fit. Recall the "cascading" nature of CSS and make sure you're re-using as many styles as possible instead of specifying new ones for every single element.
